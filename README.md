# Exploratory Data Analysis on Titanic Dataset

## Project Overview
This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to uncover insights about the factors influencing survival during the tragic sinking of the RMS Titanic. The analysis includes data wrangling, visualization, and statistical analysis to identify patterns and relationships within the dataset.

## Dataset
The Titanic dataset is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data) and contains information about the passengers, including their age, sex, class, fare, and survival status.

## Objectives
- Analyze the dataset to determine the factors that affected passenger survival.
- Visualize the data to identify trends and patterns.
- Provide insights and recommendations based on the findings.

## Tools Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebooks


## Steps Involved
1. **Data Loading**: The Titanic dataset was loaded into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Missing values were handled, and necessary data types were converted.
3. **Descriptive Statistics**: Key statistics were calculated to summarize the data.
4. **Data Visualization**: Various plots were created to explore relationships and distributions:
   - Histograms
   - Scatter plots
   - Box plots
   - Correlation heatmaps
5. **Statistical Analysis**: Trends and correlations were identified, with hypothesis testing conducted for significant factors.

## Key Findings
- Insights on the demographic groups with the highest survival rates.
- Analysis of the correlation between class, age, sex, and survival.
- Visualization of the distribution of fares among survivors and non-survivors.

## Limitations
- Some variables had a significant number of missing values which could affect the analysis.
- The dataset is limited to passengers on the Titanic and may not be generalizable to other contexts.

## Recommendations
- Further analysis could include more sophisticated modeling techniques to predict survival.
- Consider exploring additional datasets to enhance insights.

## Installation
To replicate this analysis, you will need the following Python packages:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
